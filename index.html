I am a research data scientist at the <a target="_blank" href="http://dbhi.chop.edu/">Department of Biomedical and Health Informatics (DBHi)</a> at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. 
We are building a multi-institutional clinical data research network, <a target="_blank" href="http://pedsnet.info/">PEDSnet</a>, to facilitate evidence-based decision making and clinical effectiveness research in pediatrics. I am a part of the PEDSnet data coordinating center conducting research in data quality, data extraction/integration, and text mining.

I received my postdoctoral training at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/"><span style="text-decoration: none"> National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)</a> at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), where I was a member of the Biomedical Text Mining group led by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/CBBresearch/Lu/">Dr Zhiyong Lu</a>. I earned my PhD in <a target="_blank" href="http://informationr.net/ir/12-4/colis/colis29.html">Information Science</a> degree from the<a target="_blank" href="http://www.ischool.drexel.edu/"><span style="text-decoration: none"> College of Computing and Informatics,</span></a> Drexel University under the advisement of <span class ="content"> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ischool.drexel.edu/faculty/yan/"> <span style="text-decoration: none">Dr Yuan An</span></a></span> in December 2011. More information on my doctoral dissertation can be found <a target="_self" href="dissertation.html">here</a>.
Before this, I earned an MS in Information Systems degree from the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ischool.drexel.edu/">College of Computing and Informatics</a>. I received my BTech in Information Technology degree from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.manit.ac.in/manitbhopal/">National Institute of Technology (NIT)</a>, Bhopal, India.  I finished schooling from various places in Madhya Pradesh, India.</p>

My primary research interest lies in designing computational tools and high-quality resources to accelerate biomedical knowledge discovery and clinical research. 
Some of my key data science projects include:

<h4> Data quality analysis of clinical data research networks (EHR data)</h4>
<ul>
<li class="post"><b><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/PEDSnet/Data-Quality-Analysis">PEDSnet Data Quality Toolkit</a></b>: A suite of tools designed to conduct a wide range of data quality assessments on clinical data networks, and provide tailored feedback to the data developers.
<li class="post">Data quality issue ranking<b></a></b>: Predicting the causes of data quality issues using machine learning classification.
</ul>

<h4> Drug indication expert curation and crowdsourcing (FDA Drug Labels)</h4>
<ul>
<li class="post"><b><a target="_blank" href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1532046414001853">LabeledIn</a></b>: A first-of-its kind, computable, and evidence-supported public resource on drug indications, built using named entity recognition, human annotation, and mining FDA resources <a target=“_blank” href="https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/lu/LabeledIn/">Download</a>
<li class="post"><b><a target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4369375/">Scaling Drug Indication Resources</a></b>: Scaling the drug converge of existing drug indication resources (e.g. LabeledIn) through machine learning classification and crowdsourcing.
</ul>



<h4> Understanding Encounter Forms</h4>
<ul>
