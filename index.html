I received my postdoctoral training at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/"><span style="text-decoration: none"> National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)</a> at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), where I was a member of the Biomedical Text Mining group led by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/CBBresearch/Lu/">Dr Zhiyong Lu</a>. I earned my PhD in <a target="_blank" href="http://informationr.net/ir/12-4/colis/colis29.html">Information Science</a> degree from the<a target="_blank" href="http://www.ischool.drexel.edu/"><span style="text-decoration: none"> College of Computing and Informatics,</span></a> Drexel University under the advisement of <span class ="content"> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ischool.drexel.edu/faculty/yan/"> <span style="text-decoration: none">Dr Yuan An</span></a></span> in December 2011. More information on my doctoral dissertation can be found <a target="_self" href="dissertation">here</a>.
Before this, I earned an MS in Information Systems degree from the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ischool.drexel.edu/">College of Computing and Informatics</a>. I received my BTech in Information Technology degree from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.manit.ac.in/manitbhopal/">National Institute of Technology (NIT)</a>, Bhopal, India.  I finished schooling from various places of Madhya Pradesh, India.</p>
